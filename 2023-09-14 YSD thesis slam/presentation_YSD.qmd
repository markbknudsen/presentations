## Context

Thesis written in blocks 1 & 2 autumn 2022, supervised by Torben Martinussen & Helene Rytgaard @ Biostatistics KU.

. . .

Thesis explores 3 topics relating to causal inference for non-randomized survival data:

- Can we interpret hazard ratios causally?
- A problem with Markov models for survival data.
- <p style="color:red;">Continuous-time inverse probability weighting.</p>

## Defining causal effects

Assume a binary treatment $A \in \{0, 1\}$ that is given at time $t = 0$. Wish to infer the *effect of treatment on survival*.

. . .

For each person, suppose there exists two *potential outcomes* $T^0$ and $T^1$:

- $T^0$ is the survival time if the person receives treatment.
- $T^1$ is the survival time if the person *does not* receive treatment.

. . .

The effect of treatment could then be defined as
$$
P(T^1 > t) - P(T^0 > t)
$$
i.e. how much more likely is it for the person to survive if they receive treatment vs. if they do not?

. . .

Or on the population scale: What would the survival rate be if we treated everyone vs. if we did not treat anyone?

. . .

Different from the conditional association $P(T > t \mid A = 1) - P(T > t \mid A = 0)$.

## Causal vs. conditional effects

## Randomized treatment

Assume a randomized treatment $A$. Then the subpopulation with $A = a$ is *representative* of what would have happened to the rest of the population, *had they been treated*.

Scale up subpopulation to full population size with weights
$$
W_i^a = \frac{1(A_i = a)}{P(A = a)}
$$

:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=3}

An estimate of the probability of survival, had everyone received treatment $a$:
$$
P(T^a > t) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n W_i^a 1(T_i > t)
$$

The $W_i^a$ are referred to as *inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW)*.
