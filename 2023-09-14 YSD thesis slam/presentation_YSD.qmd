## Context

Thesis written in blocks 1 & 2 autumn 2022, supervised by Torben Martinussen & Helene Rytgaard @ Biostatistics KU.

. . .

Thesis explores 3 topics relating to causal inference for non-randomized survival data:

- Do hazard ratio estimates from the Cox model have a causal interpretation for a time-dependent treatment?
- A problem with Markov models for survival data with time-dependent covariates.
- <p style="color:red;">Causal inference in continuous-time using inverse probability of treatment weights.</p>

## Defining causal effects

Assume a binary treatment $A \in \{0, 1\}$ that is given at time $t = 0$. Wish to infer the *effect of treatment on survival*.

. . .

For each person, suppose there exists two *potential outcomes* $T^0$ and $T^1$:

- $T^0$ is the survival time if the person *does not* receive treatment.
- $T^1$ is the survival time if the person receives treatment.

. . .

The effect of treatment could then be defined as
$$
P(T^1 > t) - P(T^0 > t)
$$
i.e. how much more likely is it for the person to survive if they receive treatment vs. if they do not?

. . .

Or on the population scale: What would the survival rate be if we treated everyone vs. if we did not treat anyone?

. . .

Different from the conditional association $P(T > t \mid A = 1) - P(T > t \mid A = 0)$.

## Randomized treatment

Assume a randomized treatment $A$. Then the subpopulation with $A = a$ is *representative* of what would have happened to the rest of the population, *had they been treated*.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}

Scale up subpopulation to full population size with weights
$$
W_i^a = \frac{1(A_i = a)}{P(A = a)}
$$

:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=3}

An estimate of the probability of survival, had everyone received treatment $a$:
$$
P(T^a > t) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n W_i^a 1(T_i > t)
$$

:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=4}

The $W_i^a$ are referred to as *inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW)*.

## Confounding

Suppose now that a *confounder* $X \in \{0, 1\}$ (low/high risk) affects both treatment and outcome (non-randomized data).

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}

If $X$ is the *only* confounder, then we still have representativity *within levels of $X$*. So we can pretend randomized treatment within levels of $X$.

:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=3}

So we assign different weights depending on $X$:
$$
W_i^a = \frac{1(A_i = a)}{P(A = a \mid X_i)}
$$

::: {.fragment fragment-index=4}

This works regardless of the dimension of $X$, and also for continuous covariates.

## Time-varying treatment

Consider a case where treatment is a binary counting process $A(t)$ that starts at 0 and jumps to 1 at time $\tau$ when a treatment is undertaken (e.g. surgery).

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}

Covariates $X(t)$ are also time-dependent.

:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}

Can generalize to a weight *process*
$$
W_i(t) = \frac{1}{\lambda^A(\tau \mid \mathcal{F}_{\tau-})^{A(t)} \mathrm{e}^{-\Lambda^A(t \wedge \tau)}}
$$
where $\lambda^A$ is the hazard/rate of treatment initiation and 
$$
\Lambda^A(t) = \int_0^t \lambda^A(s \mid \mathcal{F}_{s-}) \mathrm{d} s
$$

:::

::: {.fragment fragment-index=3}

The processes $W_i(t)$ are quite nice (exponential martingales), and can be estimated from data.

## A data example

Observational data ($n = 601$) from oncologists at Rigshospitalet.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%" .fragment fragment-index=1}

::: {.nonincremental}

- $T$ time from diagnosis of incurable throat cancer to death.
- $A(t)$ insertion of metalic tube (stent) into throat.
- A bunch of covariates $X(t)$, mostly measured at baseline.

::: 

::: {.fragment fragment-index=3}

Weighting does not change the conclusion much. But we did not have enough information about *time-dependent* confounders.
